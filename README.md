# Tilde

This repository is a selection of the scripts, programs, and dot files I store
in *~/.tilde*. Some were written by me while others were downloaded off the
Internet and written by others. Be aware that I use Mac OS X and some scripts
are Mac OS X only. Big binaries were omitted due to size.
